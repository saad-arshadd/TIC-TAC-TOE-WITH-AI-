# Tic Tac Toe with AI

Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe with AI project! This project is a digital version of the classic game Tic Tac Toe, where players can compete against an AI opponent. The goal is to provide a fun and challenging experience using artificial intelligence.

## Features

### Game Interface:

- **A graphical user interface (GUI) with a 3x3 grid for placing Xs and Os.**
- **Clear indications of player turns and game status (win, lose, draw).**
- **Option to reset the game and start a new match.**

### AI Opponent:

- **An AI that can play against the human player.**
- **AI uses the Minimax algorithm to make strategic moves.**
- **Different difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, Hard.**

### Game Logic:

- **Robust logic to handle win, lose, and draw conditions.**
- **Efficient checking mechanisms for the game state after each move.**

### Player Experience:

- **Smooth and responsive gameplay.**
- **Visual and audio feedback for actions and outcomes.**
- **Optional features like score tracking and move history.**

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: C
- **Libraries**: 
  - **GUI**: Tkinter, Pygame, or other GUI frameworks.
  - **AI**: Custom implementation of algorithms, potentially using NumPy for computations.

## AI Implementation

### Minimax Algorithm:

- **Recursive algorithm for decision-making.**
- **Evaluates all possible moves to choose the optimal move.**
- **Uses alpha-beta pruning to improve efficiency.**
